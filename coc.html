        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <h2>Our Pledge</h2>
        <p>We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free
            experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
            characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
            nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

        <p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and
            healthy
            community.</p>

        <h2>Our Standards</h2>

        <p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li>
            <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
            <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
            <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the
                experience</li>
            <li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind</li>
            <li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
            <li>Public or private harassment</li>
            <li>Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit
                permission</li>
            <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Enforcement Responsibilities</h2>

        <p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and
            will
            take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate,
            threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

        <p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,
            wiki
            edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
            communicate
            reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is
            officially
            representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an
            official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
            representative at an online or offline event.</p>

        <h2>Enforcement</h2>

        <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community
            leaders
            responsible for enforcement via email at <a
                href="mailto:novacodecamp@outlook.com">novacodecamp@outlook.com</a>. All complaints will be reviewed
            and
            investigated promptly and fairly.</p>

        <h2>Enforcement Guidelines</h2>

        <p>Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any
            action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:</p>

        <h3>1. Correction</h3>

        <p><em>Community Impact:</em> Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or
            unwelcome
            in the community.</p>

        <p><em>Consequence:</em> A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the
            nature
            of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be
            requested.</p>

        <h3>2. Warning</h3>

        <p><em>Community Impact:</em> A violation through a single incident or series of actions.</p>

        <p><em>Consequence:</em> A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people
            involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified
            period
            of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like
            social
            media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.</p>

        <h3>3. Temporary Ban</h3>

        <p><em>Community Impact:</em> A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate
            behavior.</p>

        <p><em>Consequence:</em> A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the
            community
            for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including
            unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
            Violating
            these terms may lead to a permanent ban.</p>

        <h3>Permanent Ban</h3>

        <p><em>Community Impact:</em> Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including
            sustained
            inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of
            individuals.</p>

        <p><em>Consequence:</em> A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.</p>
